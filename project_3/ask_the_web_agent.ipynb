    "## 2- Tool Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are strong at answering questions, but they cannot directly access external data such as live web results, APIs, or computations. In real applications, agents rarely rely only on their internal knowledge. They need to query APIs, retrieve data, or perform calculations to stay accurate and useful. Tool calling bridges this gap by allowing the LLM to request actions from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe each tool’s interface in the model’s prompt, defining what it does and what arguments it expects. When the model decides that a tool is needed, it emits a structured output like: `TOOL_CALL: {\"name\": \"get_current_weather\", \"args\": {\"city\": \"San Francisco\"}}`. Your code will detect this output, execute the corresponding function, and feed the result back to the LLM so the conversation continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will implement a simple `get_current_weather` function and teach the `gemma3` model how to use it when required in four steps:\n",
    "1. Implement the tool\n",
